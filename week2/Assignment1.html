            <h3 class="test">GLOW</h3>
            <p2>The Netflix original series GLOW has one of the more original premises in recent TV
            history: It chronicles the life of a fledgling professional wrestling promotion called the
            Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, as various aspiring actresses and generally women down
            on their luck audition and agree to take a stab at a wholly new field.</p2>

            <h3>Parks and Recreation</h3>
            <p2>What sets Parks and Recreation apart from other comedies is that it’s absolutely sincere
                and free of cynicism. It’s clear that even if the characters rib each other, there’s genuine
                love between them. But yes, the show is hilarious, and Amy Poehler’s Leslie Knope is
                one of the seminal sitcom characters of our time.</p2>

        <h3>Stranger Things</h3>
        <p2>The 80s-set mystery thriller is equal parts It, Stand by Me, and The Goonies as it mashes
            up the creepy atmosphere of a Stephen King novel with compelling characters and a
            strong narrative drive. The true test of Stranger Things is whether the show works
            without the nostalgia-inducing 80s setting, and the answer is yes.</p2>

        <h3>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</h3>
        <p2>Star Wars: The Clone Wars takes place during the title conflict, a time when Anakin
            Skywalker and his fellow Jedi Knights led the Grand Army of the Republic against the
            Separatists’ New Droid Army. It’s notable for greatly expanding (and improving on)
            Anakin Skywalker’s backstory before he took on the persona of Darth Vader.

                <p2>In the year 2045, people can escape their harsh reality in the OASIS, an immersive virtual
                    world where you can go anywhere, do anything, be anyone-the only limits are your own
                    imagination. OASIS creator James Halliday left his immense fortune and control of the
                    Oasis to the winner of a contest designed to find a worthy heir.

                    capacitor, Wade must battle ninjas, the yakuza, and a pack of sexually aggressive
                    canines, as he journeys around the world to discover the importance of family, friendship,

                    World's Best Lover.
